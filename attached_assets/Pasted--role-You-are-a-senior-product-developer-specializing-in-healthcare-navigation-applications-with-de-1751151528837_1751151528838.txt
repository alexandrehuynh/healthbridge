<task>
Pivot HealthBridge from a Canada-wide application to a Quebec-focused MVP that specifically serves the 50,000+ new permanent residents and 25,000+ international students arriving in Quebec annually. Update all content, data structures, statistics, and user flows to reflect Quebec's unique healthcare rules and waiting periods.
</task>

<context>
We're focusing on Quebec because it has the most complex and unique healthcare eligibility rules in Canada, with definite waiting periods and exceptions that most newcomers don't understand. Quebec's distinct rules around RAMQ eligibility, social security agreements, and the 5-day private insurance recommendation create a clear value proposition for a specialized navigation tool.

Quebec represents Canada's second-largest immigrant destination with specific challenges: mandatory 3-month RAMQ waiting periods, work permits often being ineligible (unlike other provinces), bilateral agreements with 30+ countries that can waive waiting periods, and critical 5-day window for private insurance enrollment.

**RAMQ Eligibility Rules to Implement:**

```javascript
const quebecEligibilityRules = {
  permanent_resident: {
    waiting_period: 90, // 3 months from application submission
    eligible: true,
    notes: "3-month waiting period applies to most PRs"
  },
  
  work_permit: {
    waiting_period: null,
    eligible: false, // Unlike other provinces!
    notes: "Work permit holders generally NOT eligible for RAMQ",
    exceptions: ["Temporary foreign workers in specific programs"]
  },
  
  study_permit: {
    eligible: false,
    notes: "International students must have private insurance",
    requirements: ["Full-time enrollment", "Private health insurance mandatory"]
  },
  
  social_security_countries: {
    // Countries with bilateral agreements - no waiting period
    eligible_countries: [
      "France", "Belgium", "Denmark", "Finland", "Luxembourg", 
      "Norway", "Portugal", "Sweden", "Greece", "United States",
      // ... add full list of 30+ countries
    ],
