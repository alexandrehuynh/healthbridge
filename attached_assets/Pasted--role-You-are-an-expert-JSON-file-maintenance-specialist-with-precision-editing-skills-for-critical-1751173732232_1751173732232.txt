<do_not_change>
‚úÖ **Leave These URLs UNCHANGED (They Work Perfectly):**

**DO NOT TOUCH any other fields in any provider object:**

</do_not_change>

<implementation_steps>
**Precise Editing Process:**

1. **Open** `client/src/data/quebec-insurance-providers.json`
2. **Locate** each provider by searching for the specific `"id"` field
3. **Find** the `"quoteUrl"` field within that provider object
4. **Replace** ONLY the URL string with the new working URL
5. **Verify** JSON syntax remains valid after each change
6. **Save** the file with changes

**Example Before/After:**
```json
// BEFORE
{
  "id": "desjardins-visitor",
  "name": "Desjardins Visitor Insurance",
  "quoteUrl": "https://www.desjardins.com/ca/personal/insurance/travel/visitors-canada/",
  // ... other fields unchanged
}

// AFTER  
{
  "id": "desjardins-visitor", 
  "name": "Desjardins Visitor Insurance",
  "quoteUrl": "https://www.desjardins.com/en/insurance/travel/visitors-canada.html",
  // ... other fields unchanged
}
```
</implementation_steps>
