<task>
Replace the current long-scrolling country selection page with a sleek, modern searchable dropdown that eliminates scrolling issues while maintaining HealthBridge's existing design patterns and bilateral agreement functionality.
</task>

<context>
The current country selection page forces users to scroll extensively through a long list of countries, creating poor UX. We need a contained, searchable solution that keeps the full page visible while providing an elegant country selection experience that integrates seamlessly with the existing HealthBridge design system.
</context>

<problem_analysis>
**Current Issues:**
- Long scrolling list of countries takes up entire page
- Poor mobile experience with excessive scrolling
- Users have to hunt through long list to find their country
- Page layout becomes unwieldy with 190+ countries

**Solution Requirements:**
- Searchable/filterable country input
- Contained element that doesn't dominate the page
- Maintains existing HealthBridge styling and patterns
- Works on mobile and desktop
- Integrates with bilateral agreement checking
- Fast, intuitive user experience
</problem_analysis>

<modern_ux_patterns>
**Recommended Approach: Searchable Combobox**
- Input field that users can type in to filter countries
- Dropdown list appears below input (max height ~300px with scroll)
- Popular Quebec immigration countries shown first
- Real-time filtering as user types
- Keyboard navigation support
- Clear selection and search functionality

**Alternative Approach: Modal Selector**
- Click to open modal with searchable country list
- Contained in overlay, doesn't affect page layout
- Large search input at top
- Categorized by regions or popularity
- Mobile-friendly full-screen experience
</alternative_ux_patterns>
