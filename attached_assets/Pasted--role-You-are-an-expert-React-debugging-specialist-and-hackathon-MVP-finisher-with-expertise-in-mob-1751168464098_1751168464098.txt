🏆 **HACKATHON CRITICAL MISSION** 🏆
- Project: HealthBridge - Quebec healthcare navigation for newcomers
- Current Status: 74% complete with winning innovation
- Timeline: URGENT - Demo presentation imminent
- Goal: Fix Priority 1 demo-breaking issues to secure hackathon victory
- Core Innovation: Bilateral agreements system (instant country → healthcare waiting period guidance)
</urgent_context>

<technical_stack>
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript, shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight routing)
- **State**: localStorage for assessment data persistence
- **Architecture**: Client-side app with JSON data files, no backend complexity
- **Key Feature**: Quebec bilateral agreement checker (our competitive advantage)
</technical_stack>

<priority_1_demo_breaking_issues>
**🚨 MUST FIX - These Will Break Our Demo:**

1. **Error Handling Gaps**
   - App crashes on unknown countries or missing data
   - No graceful fallbacks when bilateral agreement data missing
   - Console errors visible during demo
   - Files: `client/src/hooks/use-bilateral-agreement.tsx`, error boundaries needed

2. **Mobile Responsiveness Failures**
   - Judges WILL test on phones - this must be flawless
   - Country selector not touch-friendly
   - Results page not properly responsive
   - Text too small or buttons too small for mobile
   - Files: All wizard components, results page layout

3. **Insurance Provider Links Broken**
   - External links in `client/src/data/quebec-insurance-providers.json` may be dead
   - Broken links during demo = instant credibility loss
   - Need verification and fallback handling
   - File: `client/src/data/quebec-insurance-providers.json`

4. **Bilateral Agreement Integration Issues**
   - Country selection not triggering instant feedback
   - Agreement status not displaying correctly
   - Missing visual indicators (🟢🟡🔴) for agreement types
   - Our "magic moment" must be bulletproof
   - Files: `client/src/components/wizard/country-selection.tsx`, `client/src/pages/results.tsx`

5. **Missing Loading States**
   - App feels unpolished without loading indicators
   - Instant transitions feel broken to users
   - Need loading states for country selection, agreement checking
   - Files: All components that process data

6. **Edge Case Handling**
   - Unknown countries break the flow
   - Empty selections cause errors
   - Invalid data crashes components
   - Demo scenarios must handle ALL edge cases gracefully
</priority_1_demo_breaking_issues>

<critical_test_scenarios>
**Demo-Critical Countries for Testing:**
- **France**: Full agreement → 🟢 "No waiting period" (must work perfectly)
- **USA**: No agreement → 🔴 "3-month waiting period" (must be clear)
- **Germany**: Partial agreement → 🟡 "Case-by-case evaluation" (must handle complexity)
- **Unknown/Typo**: Edge case → Must not crash, graceful fallback

**Mobile Testing Requirements:**
- iPhone/Android portrait and landscape
- Touch-friendly country selection
- Readable text without zooming
- Easy navigation between wizard steps
- Results page must scroll properly on mobile
</critical_test_scenarios>

<implementation_strategy>
**Fix Order (Complete Each Before Moving to Next):**

**Step 1: Error Handling Foundation**
- Add try-catch blocks in bilateral agreement hook
- Implement error boundaries for critical components
- Add fallback UI for missing data scenarios
- Test with invalid countries and empty selections

**Step 2: Mobile Responsiveness Audit**
- Test entire app on mobile viewport (375px width)
- Fix touch targets, font sizes, spacing
- Ensure wizard flows smoothly on mobile
- Verify results page is fully usable on phones

**Step 3: Link Verification & Fixes**
- Check all insurance provider URLs in JSON file
- Replace broken links with working alternatives
- Add error handling for external link failures
- Test link opening behavior on mobile

**Step 4: Bilateral Agreement Polish**
- Ensure instant visual feedback on country selection
- Verify agreement status colors and messages
- Test the "magic moment" with all critical countries
- Add loading states during agreement checking

**Step 5: Loading States & Polish**
- Add loading spinners for data processing
- Smooth transitions between wizard steps
- Professional loading states that enhance UX
- Remove any jarring instant state changes
</implementation_strategy>

<critical_files_focus>
**Priority Files to Debug & Fix:**

1. **`client/src/hooks/use-bilateral-agreement.tsx`**
   - Core bilateral agreement logic
   - Add error handling and fallbacks
   - Ensure consistent hook behavior

2. **`client/src/components/wizard/country-selection.tsx`**
   - Country selection trigger point
   - Mobile responsiveness critical
   - Must handle unknown countries gracefully

3. **`client/src/pages/results.tsx`**
   - Where bilateral agreement status displays
   - Mobile layout must be perfect
   - Loading states needed

4. **`client/src/data/quebec-insurance-providers.json`**
   - Verify all external links work
   - Replace broken links
   - Add fallback provider data

5. **All Wizard Components**
   - Mobile responsiveness across the flow
   - Error handling consistency
   - Loading state implementation
