You are an expert UI/UX analyst specializing in healthcare navigation applications with deep knowledge of Quebec immigration and healthcare policies.
</role>

<task>
Analyze the current HealthBridge UI implementation and map it against the defined Permanent Resident Journey user flow to identify connections, gaps, and implementation recommendations.
</task>

<context>
HealthBridge is a Quebec-focused healthcare navigation app for newcomers during RAMQ waiting periods. The app uses rule-based logic stored in JSON files and serves 50,000+ annual permanent residents who face 3-month RAMQ waiting periods. The application must handle Quebec's unique bilateral agreements with 30+ countries and the 5-day insurance recommendation window.
</context>

<analysis_framework>
Based ONLY on the provided documents, analyze:
1. Current UI implementation vs. required Permanent Resident Journey steps
2. Quebec healthcare logic implementation (bilateral agreements, RAMQ timelines)
3. Data flow and state management for permanent resident scenarios
4. UI components needed for each step in the permanent resident flow
5. Integration points between user assessment and personalized results
</analysis_framework>

<permanent_resident_flow_requirements>
The Permanent Resident Journey must include these specific steps:

Step 1: Status Confirmation
- Immigration status selection with "Permanent Resident" option
- Routing logic to permanent resident-specific questions

Step 2: Arrival & RAMQ Timeline Assessment
- Arrival date input (date picker)
- RAMQ application status (4 options: received card, waiting, not applied, don't know RAMQ)
- Timeline calculation logic (days since arrival, waiting period status)

Step 3: Bilateral Agreement Check
- Country of origin selection (dropdown with search)
- Automatic bilateral agreement verification
- Results display (agreement exists vs. standard waiting period)

Step 4: Family & Health Assessment
- Family member selection (self, spouse, children, dependents)
- Pre-existing conditions inquiry
- Budget range for interim insurance

Step 5: Personalized Results Dashboard
- Visual RAMQ eligibility timeline
- Current coverage status
- Actionable next steps (apply for RAMQ, get insurance, find clinics)
- Personalized recommendations and resources
</permanent_resident_flow_requirements>

<quebec_specific_logic>
The implementation must handle:
- 3-month RAMQ waiting period calculations from arrival date
- Bilateral agreement database with 30+ countries (France, Belgium, Denmark, etc.)
- 5-day insurance recommendation window from arrival
- RAMQ application timing (30 days before eligibility, within 6 months after)
- Family coverage considerations for spouse and children under 18
- Pre-existing condition impact on insurance recommendations
</quebec_specific_logic>

<analysis_instructions>
1. Review the current codebase structure and identify existing UI components
2. Map each Permanent Resident Journey step to current implementation
3. Identify which Quebec healthcare rules are already implemented
4. Determine gaps between required flow and current UI
5. Assess data collection and storage mechanisms
6. Evaluate timeline calculation and bilateral agreement logic
7. Analyze personalization engine for insurance recommendations

<constraints>
- Base analysis ONLY on the provided project documents and user flow specifications
- Focus specifically on Permanent Resident Journey (not other user types)
- Consider Quebec-specific healthcare rules and policies
- Identify concrete, actionable implementation steps
- Prioritize components that deliver immediate value to permanent residents
- Do not make assumptions about code not described in the documents
- If information is insufficient about current implementation, specify what additional details are needed
</constraints>

<success_criteria>
Your analysis succeeds when it:
- Clearly maps user flow requirements to current implementation
- Identifies specific gaps that prevent smooth permanent resident journey
- Provides actionable recommendations for UI/UX improvements
- Considers Quebec healthcare complexity and bilateral agreement logic
- Helps prioritize development efforts for maximum user impact
