3) Solution Plan (What are you building and how?)
We are building HealthBridge — a mobile-first, multilingual web application designed to assist newcomers to Canada, particularly new permanent residents, in navigating the confusing and critical period before they become eligible for public healthcare.
What We’re Building:
HealthBridge is a user-friendly, AI-powered platform that:
Tracks the user's arrival date and identifies whether they’re currently in the 3-month waiting period.


Explains health insurance options using simple, culturally sensitive language.


Offers a personalized insurance assistant, helping users filter and compare short-term private plans based on budget, health needs, and eligibility.


Guides users through Interim Federal Health Program (IFHP) access (for eligible refugee claimants).


Maps and lists low-cost or newcomer-friendly clinics, telehealth providers, and pharmacy discount options.


Sends notifications and reminders about when public coverage becomes available.


How We’re Building It:
Frontend: ReactJS / React Native (for cross-platform mobile responsiveness)


Backend: Firebase (auth, Firestore, cloud functions)


AI Integration: GPT-4 or Dialogflow for chatbot assistance + insurance comparison logic


APIs Used: Google Maps (clinic locator), Medimap, Twilio (reminders), public health data


Languages Supported: English, French, Arabic, Mandarin



4) Tools & Tech (AI models, no-code tools, APIs, etc.)
To build the first version of HealthBridge, we’re using a mix of no-code tools, AI models, and APIs to develop a fast, scalable, and user-friendly mobile-first web app—without needing a full development team.
Core Development Tools
Replit – for developing and testing the app using JavaScript and React, with MongoDB to store user data securely.


Bubble (no-code tool) – for designing and building a responsive web and mobile interface, allowing rapid prototyping and deployment without heavy coding.
AI & Smart Assistance
ChatGPT (GPT-4 API) – powers an in-app chatbot to answer questions in simple, personalized language, helping users understand coverage and next steps.


Google Translate API – enables real-time content translation into multiple languages, including English, French, Arabic, Mandarin, and Twi, improving accessibility for diverse newcomers.


APIs & External Services
Clinic Map Integration: Embeds a map showing nearby clinics that:


Accept newcomers (with or without insurance)


Offer low-cost or free care


Speak the user's language


Quiz Engine (custom-built): A short quiz that recommends private insurance plans based on immigration status, budget, and time in Canada, explained in clear, simple language.


Reminder System: Sends timely alerts to remind users when their 3-month public coverage wait is ending so they don’t miss application deadlines.
 Security & Independence
All features are designed to function independently of government systems, with no sensitive health data stored, ensuring privacy and ease of adoption. The goal is to provide newcomers with instant guidance, practical tools, and peace of mind during a critical transition period.

5) Solution Overview: A one-paragraph explanation, with optional sketches/mockups.
HealthBridge (or BeginWell) is a mobile-first web application designed to support newcomers to Canada during the critical 3-month waiting period before they become eligible for public health insurance. The app helps users determine their coverage status based on immigration type and arrival date, then connects them to affordable or free healthcare options—including clinics that accept uninsured patients, trusted private insurance plans, and IFHP support for refugees. Using AI, the app offers personalized recommendations, insurance comparisons based on needs like pre-existing conditions and budget, and multilingual guidance in English, French, Arabic, Mandarin, and Twi. It includes an eligibility wizard, real-time clinic maps, prescription discount tools, and smart reminders to notify users when their wait is nearly over. By simplifying a confusing process with clear information and proactive support, HealthBridge empowers newcomers to make informed choices and protect their health from day one.
