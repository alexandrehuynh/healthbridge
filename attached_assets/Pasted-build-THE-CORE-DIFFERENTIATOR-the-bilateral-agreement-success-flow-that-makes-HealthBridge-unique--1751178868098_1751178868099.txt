build THE CORE DIFFERENTIATOR - the bilateral agreement success flow that makes HealthBridge unique and hackathon-winning.
üí° Strategic Product Insight
The Logic Breakthrough:

Bilateral Agreement Countries (France, etc.): Coverage active immediately ‚Üí NO INSURANCE NEEDED ‚ú®
Non-Bilateral Countries (USA, etc.): 3-month wait ‚Üí Insurance required as fallback
Current Flow Problem: Shows insurance to everyone (wrong logic!)

The Magic We Need to Build:
Transform the app from "insurance comparison tool" to "bilateral agreement navigator"
üé™ Demo Strategy Transformation
Current Demo (Boring):
"Here's our insurance comparison tool" ‚Üê Everyone has this
Winning Demo (Magic):
"Watch what happens when someone from France uses our app..." ‚Üí ‚ú® INSTANT COVERAGE! ‚Üí "No insurance needed!"
This IS your competitive advantage!

  'italy', 'luxembourg', 'netherlands', 'norway', 
  'portugal', 'sweden', 'romania'
];

// Route logic
if (bilateralCountries.includes(userCountry)) {
  // Route to SUCCESS page (no insurance needed)
  router.push('/bilateral-success');
} else {
  // Route to INSURANCE page (fallback for non-bilateral)
  router.push('/insurance-options');
}
