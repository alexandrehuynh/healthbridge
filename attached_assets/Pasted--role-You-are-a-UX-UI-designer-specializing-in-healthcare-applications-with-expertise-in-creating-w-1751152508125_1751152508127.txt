</role>

<task>
Transform HealthBridge from a text-heavy blue interface into a visually engaging, warm Quebec healthcare navigation tool. Add meaningful illustrations, icons, and graphics that help newcomers feel welcomed and confident about navigating Quebec's healthcare system.
</task>

<context>
HealthBridge serves 50,000+ new permanent residents and 25,000+ international students arriving in Quebec annually. The current interface is primarily blue gradients with minimal visuals. Users are often stressed, dealing with language barriers, and need visual cues to understand complex RAMQ eligibility rules and insurance options during their 3-month waiting period.
</context>

<visual_design_requirements>
**Design Philosophy:**
- Warm, welcoming atmosphere that reduces anxiety
- Culturally inclusive representations of diverse Quebec newcomers
- Clear visual communication for non-native French/English speakers
- Government-quality trustworthiness with modern, approachable styling

**Color Palette Enhancement:**
- Primary: Keep existing blues but add warmth
- Secondary: Soft greens (#10B981), warm oranges (#F59E0B)
- Neutrals: Warm grays, not cold grays
- Accent: Quebec-inspired colors (subtle fleur-de-lis blue #1E40AF)

**Illustration Style:**
- Modern, friendly vector illustrations (unDraw or Humaaans style)
- Diverse representation: Different ethnicities, ages, family structures
- Quebec context: Subtle Montreal/Quebec City landmarks where appropriate
- Avoid overly corporate or medical imagery
</visual_design_requirements>

<specific_visual_elements_needed>
**1. Landing Page Hero Graphics**
```jsx
// Replace the brain image with warm, welcoming illustration
<div className="hero-illustration">
  {/* Diverse family (parents + children) arriving in Quebec */}
  {/* Subtle Quebec landmarks in background */}
  {/* Luggage, documents, hopeful expressions */}
  {/* Modern vector style, not photorealistic */}
</div>
```

**2. Assessment Wizard Step Illustrations**
```jsx
// Each step gets a small supporting graphic
const stepIllustrations = {
  immigration_status: "Person with different status documents",
  country_origin: "World map with highlighted agreement countries", 
  ramq_application: "Person filling out RAMQ application",
  insurance_needs: "Shield/protection icon with family"
};
```

**3. Insurance Comparison Card Enhancements**
```jsx
// Add provider logos and visual coverage representations
<div className="insurance-card">
  <div className="provider-visual">
    {/* Insurance company logo/icon */}
    {/* Coverage level visualization (shields, checkmarks) */}
  </div>
  {/* Existing pricing and features */}
</div>
```

**4. Quebec-Specific Visual Elements**
- RAMQ card illustration (not actual card, but representative)
- Quebec map showing coverage areas
- Montreal skyline silhouette in headers/footers
- Bilingual text bubbles (French/English) where appropriate
- Cultural diversity: Various ethnicities common in Quebec immigration

**5. Timeline/Progress Visualizations**
```jsx
// Visual waiting period countdown
<div className="waiting-period-visual">
  {/* Calendar or timeline showing 3-month progression */}
  {/* Visual indicators for key dates */}
  {/* Insurance coverage overlay */}
</div>
```
</specific_visual_elements_needed>

<technical_implementation>
**Image Integration Requirements:**

1. **Performance Optimized**
```jsx
// Use next/image or optimized React image components
import Image from 'next/image';

// SVG icons for scalability
import { IconComponent } from '@/components/icons';

// Lazy loading for non-critical images
<Image 
  src="/illustrations/hero-family.svg"
  alt="Diverse family arriving in Quebec"
  width={600}
  height={400}
  priority={false}
  className="responsive-illustration"
/>
```

2. **Responsive Design**
```css
/* Mobile-first responsive illustrations */
.hero-illustration {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 500px;
  height: auto;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .hero-illustration {
    max-width: 600px;
  }
}
```

3. **Accessibility Standards**
- Meaningful alt text for all illustrations
- Proper contrast ratios maintained
- Icons supplemented with text labels
- Cultural sensitivity in visual representations
